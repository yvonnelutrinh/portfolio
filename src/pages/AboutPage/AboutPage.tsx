                                I connect design and code to create experiences that actually matter. Ever noticed how the best digital products feel almost invisible? That's what I'm afterâ€”the sweet spot where you're so engaged with what you're doing that the technology fades into the background.

                                After 7+ years working across marketing, communications, and creative tech, I've learned that pretty interfaces without purpose are just digital decoration. My time in arts, nonprofits, and government shaped a core belief: technology should amplify human potential, not replace it. What's the point of innovation if it doesn't create meaningful connections or solve real problems?
